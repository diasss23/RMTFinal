# RMTFinal
Final project for RMT course. Bus arrival time prediction
In this rep you find the actual code with LSTM model and GRU. At first, I also used the Random Forest model, but the results were weak compared to LSTM, so it was decided to remove the Random Forest model. In addition to the code itself, there will be a link to an article that was written for this project. I also found dataset from GitHub. I will attached dataset here
